SHORT-DESCRIPTION:
Two player chance game implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

GAME INSTRUCTIONS:
This game is based purely on luck! Players each take turns rolling a die continously, until 
they choose to stop or until the die lands on a 1. During a players turn, they have a current 
count which always starts at 0 at the beginning of a players turn. While they roll the die, each 
number the die lands on gets added to the current count. If the player chooses to end their 
turn, the current count is added to their total count. However, if the die lands on 1, the 
player looses their current count, which gets reset back to 0, and it is the next persons turn.
